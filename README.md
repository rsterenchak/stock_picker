This program returns the best buy and sell array indexes based on which days have the highest total profit value. The buy day must be a lower value and must come before the sell day for the value to be valid. I accomplish this by iterating through the array using a while loop for consistent comparisons with adding/removing from my buy/sell array. An enumerable 'each' method is also used for iterating of the start value from beginning to the ending of the array.
